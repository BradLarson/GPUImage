 and implemented in OpenGL ES by 

 A. Ensor, S. Hall. GPU-based Image Analysis on Mobile Devices. Proceedings of Image and Vision Computing New Zealand 2011.

 It starts with a conversion to luminance, followed by an accelerated 9-hit Gaussian blur. A Sobel operator is applied to obtain the overall
 gradient strength in the blurred image, as well as the direction (in texture sampling steps) of the gradient. A non-maximum suppression filter
 acts along the direction of the gradient, highlighting strong edges that pass the threshold and completely removing those that fail the lower 
 threshold. Finally, pixels from in-between these thresholds are either included in edges or rejected based on neighboring pixels.
